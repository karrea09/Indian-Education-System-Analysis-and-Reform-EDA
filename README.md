# 📚 Indian Education System: Analysis, Issues & Policy Recommendations

## 📌 Overview

This project is an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) aimed at identifying and understanding the core factors contributing to the challenges in the Indian education system — including rising student suicide rates, operational inefficiencies, and scams. The project also compares India's situation with top-performing global education systems and proposes actionable policy recommendations based on successful international models.

## 🧠 Objectives

- Analyze student suicide rates linked to academic pressure
- Identify major operational failures and educational scams
- Compare India with top 10 countries in education (based on PISA scores and policy benchmarks)
- Extract key policy features from successful education systems
- Recommend data-backed solutions for reforming Indian education

## 📊 Datasets Used

- NCRB (National Crime Records Bureau) - Student Suicide Statistics  
- News Reports & Government Sources - Education Scams and Failures  
- OECD & PISA Reports - Global Education System Performance  
- Custom Comparative Tables for Policy Analysis

---

## 📈 Key Insights

- High correlation between academic pressure and student suicides
- Operational gaps and recurring scams weaken public trust
- Indian education system is largely exam-centric and lacks creativity-focused approaches
- Global leaders (e.g., Finland, Singapore, Japan) focus on holistic development, teacher training, and flexibility

---

## 🌍 Policy Inspiration from Global Systems

- **Singapore:** “Teach Less, Learn More” initiative, bilingual policy, critical thinking focus
- **Finland:** No standardized testing, high teacher autonomy, no homework in early grades
- **South Korea:** National curriculum rigor, high parental involvement, hagwon expansion
- **Japan:** Moral education, reduced hours under Yutori Kyoiku, strong funding
- **Canada & Germany:** Multicultural policies, dual education models, tuition-free universities

---

## ✅ Final Outcome

- Developed a comparative framework for analyzing India’s performance vs top systems
- Visualized state-level improvements in Kerala and Tamil Nadu after policy changes
- Framed policy recommendations to shift from exam-centric to holistic education
